This is a online research notebook, in which I would write down some important or interesting formula derivations, tips for geophysical/coding tools and typical examples when using GMT for figure generation.

这是一个在线科研笔记本，我会在这里记录科研过程中遇到的有用的公式推导、工具的使用和利用GMT6画图的一些实例。

Hope you could find something helpful here.
