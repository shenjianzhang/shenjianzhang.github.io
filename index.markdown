I am a PhD. candidate at Institute of Theoretical and Applied Geophysics, Peking University, supervised by Prof. Shiyong Zhou. I'm interested in simulations of global seismograms, topography of the boudaries underground, (e.g. boundaries of mantle transition zone, CMB), and prompt elasto-gravitational sigals (PEGS).
