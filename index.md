## ZHANG, Shenjian   张申健

I am a PhD. candidate at Institute of Theoretical and Applied Geophysics, Peking University, supervised by Prof. Shiyong Zhou. I'm interested in simulations of global seismograms, topography of the boudaries underground, (e.g. boundaries of mantle transition zone, CMB), and prompt elasto-gravitational sigals (PEGS).

### Education

Developing the method of finite frequency receiver function using variation method.   

- **2015.09 - 2016.10**, *The finite frequency effect on receiver function inversion method.*   
Advisor: Dr. Shiyong Zhou.   
Developed the method of calculation for multimode surface wave sensitivity kernels.   

- **2014.06 - 2015.08**, *The b-value variations in Southwest China.*   
Advisor: Dr. Shiyong Zhou.   
Calculated the b-value distribution in Southwest China using Bayesian method and spline functions.
